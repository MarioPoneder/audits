# Public Audit Findings

Being unable to publicly share my past proprietary development work and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) findings, I am glad that I've started to participate in decentralized audits which allows me to publish my bug reports once they are judged.

## [Sherlock](https://app.sherlock.xyz/)
Note that I am also listing issues here which were labeled as `Excluded` due to the strict `High`/`Medium` only policy at Sherlock.  
However, those issues are still valid & valuable for the sponsor and most of them contain a coded PoC, therefore they might be a good read for new aspiring auditors.
